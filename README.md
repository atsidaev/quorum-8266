# Quorum-8266

Quorum-8266 is a port of [esp8266-zxspectrum-emulator](https://github.com/aldolo69/esp8266_zxspectrum_emulator). 

Since ESP8266 has only 80k of RAM, we cannot do 128k. 
So is reasonable to emulate the most advanced ZX Spectrum 48k compatible machines. Quorum with its shadow RAM and CP/M capabilities
looks like a good choise.

## Current state
Basic [schematics](./schematics) is finished. Next stage will be PCB routing.
